## Voice to Self-Organizing Second Brain for Obsidian

Unlock the power of voice capture and go faster.

Open Augi ("auggie") is an open source augmented intelligence plugin for Obsidian. It's designed for people who like to think out loud (like me).

Just capture your voice note, drop hints to Augi, and let Open Augi's agentic workflow process your note into a self-organizing second brain for you.

This is designed to run in a separate folder within your vault. Any agentic actions taken on existing notes, not created by Augi, will be sent to you for review.

Let Open Augi process and organize your thoughts so you can go further, faster.
